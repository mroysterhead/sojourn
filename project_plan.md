idk where to get started so I'll just start braindumping 
# Things to solve for
1. Define Project Goals and Requirements
Identify Services: List all services you want to include (e.g., email, calendar, contacts, file sync, IRC bouncer, VPN).
Specify Requirements: Determine the requirements for each service, including performance, storage, scalability, and security.
Choose Cloud Providers: Decide which cloud providers you will use (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
2. Set Up Version Control
Repository Creation: Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or another version control platform.
Initial Commit: Add a README file outlining the project goals and initial structure.
3. Design Infrastructure
Terraform Configuration: Create Terraform scripts to define and manage your infrastructure as code.
Providers Configuration: Set up provider configurations for your chosen cloud providers.
Resource Definitions: Define resources such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, and instances.
4. Containerization
Dockerfiles: Write Dockerfiles for each service to containerize the applications.
Docker Compose: Use Docker Compose for local development and testing of multi-container applications.
5. Set Up Kubernetes
Cluster Creation: Use Terraform to provision a Kubernetes cluster on your chosen cloud provider.
Helm Charts: Create or use existing Helm charts to manage your Kubernetes deployments.
Namespace and RBAC: Set up namespaces and role-based access control (RBAC) for better management and security.
6. CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration: Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or another CI tool to build and test your Docker images.
Continuous Deployment: Configure CD pipelines to deploy your services to the Kubernetes cluster automatically.
7. Service Configuration
Environment Variables: Use environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to manage configuration settings securely.
Ingress and Networking: Configure Kubernetes Ingress to expose your services and manage traffic.
8. Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring Tools: Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track the performance and health of your services.
Logging Solutions: Implement a centralized logging solution like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki.
9. Documentation
Project Documentation: Document your infrastructure setup, service configurations, and deployment procedures.
User Guides: Create guides for deploying and managing the services included in Project Sojourn.
10. Testing and Iteration
Initial Deployment: Deploy the initial version of Project Sojourn to a staging environment.
Testing: Thoroughly test each service to ensure they work as expected.
Feedback and Iteration: Collect feedback, identify issues, and iterate on the design and implementation.
Resources and Tools
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code tool.
Docker: Containerization platform.
Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform.
Helm: Kubernetes package manager.
CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana.
Logging: ELK Stack, Loki.
