# Project Sojourn
Revitilizing and modernize the original intent of  [Project Soverign](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign)
## Overview

**Project Sovereign** aims to empower individuals and organizations to reclaim their digital sovereignty by providing an easy-to-deploy, maintainable, and scalable private cloud solution. By leveraging modern tools such as containers and Terraform, Project Sovereign will offer a robust platform for hosting essential services including email, calendar, contacts, file sync, IRC bouncer, VPN, and more.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress. Many sections of this README are placeholders and will be updated as development progresses.

## Architecture

Project Sovereign will be built with a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and scalability:

1. **Containers:** Services will be containerized for consistency and ease of deployment.
2. **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform will be used to automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
3. **Configuration Management:** Ansible will handle configuration management and deployment automation.

## Getting Started
